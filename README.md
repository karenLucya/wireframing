# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide or blueprint that represents the skeletal framework of a website, application, or digital product. It outlines the structure, layout, and placement of key elements on each page, without focusing on design details like color or graphics.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design and development process because it:

- Helps translate abstract ideas into clear, visual representations.  
- Serves as a communication tool among designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- Allows early detection of usability and layout issues before development.  
- Saves time and resources by simplifying changes and feedback in the early stages.  

In essence, wireframing bridges the gap between ideas and execution, ensuring that the final product is user-friendly and well-structured.
